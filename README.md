# MNIST-classification

under this project, i have taken the MNIST dataset which is a dataset of images(stored in form of arrays of pixel intensity) of digits from 0-9

this project predits the digit on the image with about 90% accuracy. 
this accuracy is low, and i am working on improving it with approximately 97% accuracy. 

with this classification project, i learnt many new tricks and concepts.

concepts like :
- using OvO & OvR used for multiclass classification
- confusion matric
- cross_val_predict and cross_val_score
- precision recall tradeoff
- roc curve, area under roc curve
- displaying the digit using the pixel intensities provided.
- error analysis


i used mainly SGDClassifier and RandomForestClassifier for my predictions and am currently working on improving the accuracy using KNN model.
